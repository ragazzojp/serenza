# Serenza

Serenza is the codename of this project.
It's not clear if it will have an official name, one day.

## What is it

The project will be described at a later stage.
So far, they're only flashing words.

## Word lists

Word lists are taken from:

https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords
http://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles2016.php

and processed with the `filterwords.py` script to format the
lists in JSON by selecting only words that a minimum
number of references (e.g. 150).

Only IT, EN, FR and DE are supported, but new languages
can be easily added by filtering and converting one of the
files in the `FrequencyWords` repository.
